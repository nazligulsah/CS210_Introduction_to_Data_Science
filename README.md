One of our aims is to investigate if some features of the movies affect their popularity or revenue. Our hypothesis 
is that genre, budget and runtime would affect popularity. Certain genres may be distinct from the other features. 
Our prediction is that a high budget may increase the chance of popularity and the runtime would affect people’s interests. 
People may prefer more less runtime movies or vice versa depending on their time and their focusing.  Our claim about 
the revenue is that it is affected by spoken language and its genre. If the spoken language is non-English or it is less 
common around the world, the revenue may be less. Moreover, people’s common interests (e.g. action, romance, comedy) would 
make some genres advantageous among the others in the Box-Office. Furthermore, another aim is to analyze the relation between 
revenue, budget and profit.  To analyze if it is worth spending a lot of money or can production companies gain profit with 
low budget movies too. Moreover, for analyzing the relation between production country number and the budget, Our prediction is 
that shooting in more than one country would require more budget.
